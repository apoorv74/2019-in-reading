> Now the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and extend good wishes to you. I will not do that, and I’ll tell you why. From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.

- Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
> If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left  standing,  then  that  rationality  will  simply  produce  another factory. If a revolution destroys a 
government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact,then those patterns will repeat themselves. 
There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.

- Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius.
> Judge your success in life by how well you make your decisions, not by your outcome. You have full control of your decisions, and often no control at all over their results.

- Alan Watts
> We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.
